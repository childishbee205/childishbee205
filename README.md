# Hello there
## About Me
I'm Krishang, a final year undergraduate student in Physics at IIT Kanpur.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m learning how to simulate models used in statistical physics (primarily variants of the Ising model, for now). In the process, I'm trying to pick up Monte-Carlo simulation, basics of numpy/scipy, visualisation using matplotlib, as well as how to speed up calculations using parallelisation, 'jitting', and so on. It's quite fun.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working largely with python and its libraries. Acquianted with C, will get to C++ eventually.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the above. I'm a complete novice, so any advice is welcome, really.
